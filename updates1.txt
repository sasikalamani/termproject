Only one document in the file was changed except for 
the code artifacts and the time sheet which was the project proposal.
The proposal now explains the second level which is the level with
the jelly. It also describes the power ups. There is no timer 
for the game, instead it is the number of moves. Also, the last level where
the user create his/her own level will not include chocolate anymore.
